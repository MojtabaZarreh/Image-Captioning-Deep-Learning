# Image-Captioning-Deep-Learning

Hello,
This was a practice project for better understanding
In this project, we tried to use deep neural network to insert descriptions for images (textual and audio).

I used Inception V3 for feature extraction from images.

Also, LSTM has been used for the text generation process for images.

In this project, I tried to play the description of the image in audio form.
